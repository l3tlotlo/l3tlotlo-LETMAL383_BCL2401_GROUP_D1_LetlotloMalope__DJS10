Used Fetch API to asynchronously fetch blog posts from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts. 
Stored the fetched posts in the application's state. Used React hooks useState and useEffect to manage state and side effects.
Caught errors that might occur during the API call. If an error occurs, it is caught and stored in the state.
If the API call is successful, post's title and body are displayed in the application.
If the API call fails, display a user-friendly error message will display.
Ensured that the application does not crash.
